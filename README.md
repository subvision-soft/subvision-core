# SubvisionCV Core

**SubvisionCV Core** is the WebAssembly (WASM) build of the core C++ algorithms powering
the [Subvision](https://github.com/subvision-soft) underwater target shooting scoring system. This core is designed to
run efficiently in web environments using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Subvision is a mobile and web app developed to detect, locate, and score impacts on underwater target shooting sheets.
It aims to be validated by the **FFESSM** (French Underwater Federation) for official competition use.

## Features

- C++ core logic for:
    - Sheet detection
    - Target detection
    - Impact localization
    - Score computation
- WebAssembly build for browser usage
- Dockerized build environment for consistency

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Internet access to pull the image `ghcr.io/subvision-soft/subvision-emscripten:2025.6.1`

---

## Docker Image

Builds use the `ghcr.io/subvision-soft/subvision-emscripten:2025.6.1` Docker image, which is maintained in
the [Subvision Stack project](https://github.com/subvision-soft/subvision-stack).

This image includes:

- Emscripten SDK
- OpenCV with pkg-config
- CMake and other tools required for building C++ and WASM

---

## How to Build

Run the following commands depending on your target:

```bash
# Build both versions (standard + ES6)
make all

# Build the standard WebAssembly version
make subvision

# Build the ES6 module WebAssembly version
make subvision_es6
```

The output will be located in the build_wasm/ directory.
